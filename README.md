## Idea

The purpose of this project is for educators to submit their students assignments, written by hand for plagiarism detection. The current cheating detection system online only works with documents written by an application. 

## How it Works / More Info

The plagiarism works by taking two png/jpeg images and using textual conversion machine learning library to convert them to digital text. The user is returned with the parsed text and two percentage representing the similarity and uniqueness respectively. 

## Built Using

- Django
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap CSS
- Tesseract and OpenCV
- PySimilar

## Notes

This project is our submission for the Hack3 hackathon on June 27, 2021.

Team: Sanjay Seenivasan, Roozbeh Ali, Andrew Tang, Matthew Tang
